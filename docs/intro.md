This course is designed in such a way that you will learn the basics of HTML and then move towards more advanced topics of HTML. To ensure full utilization of this course we encourage you to follow along with the course. We recommend to write the code along with us to ensure complete understanding.

Now lets start this **_exciting journey of HTML_**.

## Development Environment

Development is fun when you use the correct set of tools to help you assist along the way. Let's setup the **Development Environment** for HTML.

### Code Editor

Code Editor is program where you will be writing your program. It is one of the most important part of development, and also it determines developer experience.

We recommend **Visual Studio Code ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download/))** for code editor as it is one of the best and feature rich code editor that is used in industry.

### Extensions

**VS Code** provides you with a lot of extensions that you can install to improve developer experience and also to increase the features. The follow are the extensions that we recommend you to install.

- **Emmet** : It is one of the most useful extension of VS Code. It is _in-built_ in VS Code but just in case it's not installed by default you can install it from the extension store.
- **Auto Rename Tag** : It is also one of the most useful extension for HTML development. This helps to rename the closing tag automatically as you rename the opening tag. It saves a lot of time and effort and enhances your developer experience.

- **Live Server** : HTML by default doesn't offer _hot reload_. But you can achieve it with the help of this extension. This extension helps you to reload the application as soon as you make changes to your code.
